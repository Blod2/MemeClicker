This clicker program is hell for your processor. On every click that provides auto-meme-mining creating a new thread that works in a loop.
All those threads work with single object, that contains current and total amount of memes mined.
I don't really know what will happen when you'll get to maximum amount of threads for your computer. Use with care for your own  risk.
